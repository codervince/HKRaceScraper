                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

Near the 300 Metres, GLORY BOY was bumped by PERFECT HEDGE which shifted out.
At the 300 Metres, CHARTER VICTORIA got its head on the side and shifted in abruptly, resulting in its rider having to stop riding and straighten.

                Whilst in the saddling stalls, KIM GLORY had its left front plate refitted.  KIM GLORY was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.
NAMJONG SURPRISE was shifted across behind runners in the early stages and shortly after the start was hampered by DINING STAR which shifted in after being bumped by CHEERS VICTORIES.
KING OF HOUSEHOLD was crowded for room on jumping between PALEPALE and EASY SUCCESS which shifted out.
LOADS OF JOY began only fairly and then, despite being ridden along in the early stages, was slow to muster speed.
KING OF HOUSEHOLD travelled keenly in the early stages and passing the 900 Metres was awkwardly placed close to the heels of CHEERS VICTORIES.
Approaching the 800 Metres, NAMJONG SURPRISE commenced to over-race and got its head up repeatedly when being checked away from the heels of COSTA DEL SOL before making the turn after the 700 Metres awkwardly.
Making the turn after the 700 Metres, KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked when crowded for room between SUNSHINE KID and KIM GLORY which got its head on the side and shifted out.
Approaching the 400 Metres, COSTA DEL SOL was shifted out away from the heels of DINING STAR after being awkwardly placed behind that horse.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of KING OF HOUSEHOLD, N Callan stated that with the blinkers applied, his mount was inclined to over-race in the early stages.  He said however that after the 900 Metres he was able to have KING OF HOUSEHOLD travel more kindly.  He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when obliged to race back in the field, PALEPALE appeared to resent the kickback as the horse raced with its head up and was galloping awkwardly.  A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of KING OF HOUSEHOLD, N Callan stated that with the blinkers applied, his mount was inclined to over-race in the early stages.  He said however that after the 900 Metres he was able to have KING OF HOUSEHOLD travel more kindly.  He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when obliged to race back in the field, PALEPALE appeared to resent the kickback as the horse raced with its head up and was galloping awkwardly.  A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
KIM GLORY, EASY SUCCESS and CHEERS VICTORIES were sent for sampling.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when obliged to race back in the field, PALEPALE appeared to resent the kickback as the horse raced with its head up and was galloping awkwardly.  A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

M L Yeung’s (HAPPY CENTENARY) whip broke near the 400 Metres.
Approaching the 200 Metres, SUPER STRIKE and MONEY CAFE raced tight as both horses attempted to improve into a run in advance between GIGGLES FOREVER and WINNING PREMIUM.  For some distance after this, SUPER STRIKE and MONEY CAFE continued to race tight and bumped on a number of occasions as MONEY CAFE (U Rispoli) attempted to shift to the inside of WINNING PREMIUM.  This resulted in both SUPER STRIKE and MONEY CAFE being checked when disappointed for running between GIGGLES FOREVER and WINNING PREMIUM approaching the 100 Metres.  U Rispoli was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that both he and Jockey Leung were attempting the same run in the initial stages, he should have, in the circumstances, desisted from his endeavours to improve inside WINNING PREMIUM.
Over the concluding stages, MONEY CAFE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of SMART UNION.
Also over the concluding stages, GRAND HARBOUR lay in towards the running rail.
A veterinary inspection of SUNSHINE DAY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

                RED ADVENTURE was withdrawn on 3.1.15 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (swollen right fore fetlock) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter YOU KNOW I WIN (H W Lai).  Before being allowed to race again, RED ADVENTURE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
FOLLOW THE WIND was difficult to load.  Before being allowed to race again, FOLLOW THE WIND will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.
FOLLOW THE WIND shifted out at the start and bumped ON THE WAY.
HIGH SPEED METRO was crowded for room on jumping between ALL MY BENEFIT and HEAR THE ROAR, both of which shifted ground.
When being steadied to obtain cover near the 1500 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO got its head up and proved difficult to settle.
For some distance passing the 1200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON, which was proving difficult to settle, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of COLOURFUL PROFIT which was steadied away from the heels of COOL PAL.
After the 1000 Metres, GLAMOROUS RYDER was left racing wide and without cover.
Near the 650 Metres, FIERY PATROL was awkwardly placed close to the heels of FOLLOW THE WIND.

D Whyte was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground in similar circumstances.
At the 200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON, which was closing off the race strongly, was checked away from the heels of COOL PAL and in doing so shifted out and brushed COLOURFUL PROFIT which then got its head on the side and shifted out away from TRIUMPHANT DRAGON, causing HIGH SPEED METRO, which was racing outside COLOURFUL PROFIT, to be inconvenienced.
For the majority of the race, ON THE WAY was obliged to race wide and without cover.
M Guyon (HEAR THE ROAR) was spoken to regarding him having raised his whip arm above the height of his shoulder.
When questioned, W M Lai (ALL MY BENEFIT) stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in about a midfield position as it had raced well to run second two starts ago over the course and distance when ridden in this manner.  A veterinary inspection of ALL MY BENEFIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
A veterinary inspection of YOU KNOW I WIN immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in the left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, YOU KNOW I WIN, which finished tailed out, will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when obliged to race back in the field, PALEPALE appeared to resent the kickback as the horse raced with its head up and was galloping awkwardly.  A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when obliged to race back in the field, PALEPALE appeared to resent the kickback as the horse raced with its head up and was galloping awkwardly.  A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
KIM GLORY, EASY SUCCESS and CHEERS VICTORIES were sent for sampling.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of KING OF HOUSEHOLD, N Callan stated that with the blinkers applied, his mount was inclined to over-race in the early stages.  He said however that after the 900 Metres he was able to have KING OF HOUSEHOLD travel more kindly.  He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.

A veterinary inspection of PALEPALE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
GIANT TREASURE, FLAME HERO and WINNING LEADER were sent for sampling.

He said although KING OF HOUSEHOLD was checked after the 700 Metres, the horse was able to recover from this incident and travelled well until rounding the Home Turn at which point he placed it under pressure, however, the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened under riding in the Straight.  He added following the race he recommended to connections that they consider removing the blinkers from KING OF HOUSEHOLD given the manner in which it raced in the early stages and also they should give consideration to re-applying the tongue tie as the horse had previously raced well in that piece of equipment.  A veterinary inspection of KING OF HOUSEHOLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PALEPALE, M Chadwick stated that, despite being vigorously ridden in the early stages, PALEPALE did not show early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.

                WONDERFUL GUY and LITTLE MEN were slow to begin.
JOLLY VICTOR began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between SANTA FE SUN and VICTORY MASTER which was taken in by GIANT TREASURE.
After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in today’s race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR’s failure in today’s race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HELENE HAPPY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
